	<p>	Chinese Poker Rules </p>
	<p>
	This game is set for 4 players.
	Each player receives a 13-card hand from a standard 52-card deck.
	Each player then divide their cards into 3 poker hands :
		- the first hand will contain 3 cards  
		- the middle hand will contain 5 cards 
		- the last hand will contain 5 cards
	When setting your 3 poker hands, keep in mind that:
		- for the first hand, Straight and Flush do not count : are only allowed High Card, One pair, and Three of a Kind
		- the first hand value must be lower than the middle hand value, thus making the first hand the lowest-ranking hand
		- the middle hand value must be lower than the last hand value, thus making the last hand the highest-ranking hand

	<p> Once every player are ready, the player hands are compared (AKA the showdown) :
		- the player first hands are compared, and the player with the best first hand scores a point 
		- the player middle hands are compared, and the player with the best middle hand scores a point
		- the player last hands are compared, and the player with the best last hand scores a point
		In the case of a draw between players, no one scores a point.
		if the same player scores 2 or 3 points, the player scores an extra point (AKA a scoop).
